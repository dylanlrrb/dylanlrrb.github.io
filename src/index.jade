          | Hey! I'm Dylan.
          br
          | I'm an engineer at heart - I love tinkering with things, taking stuff apart, and creating problems just for the satisfaction of solving them. 
          br
          br
          |         That being said, I'm not interested in solving trivial problems like maintaining blogs.
          br
          br
          | I want to figure out how to use bleeding edge technology to solve huge, interesting, and important problems in medicine, the environment, and aerospace.
          br
          br
          |         I want to create the world that sci-fi movies painted for us. If you need me - I'll be dragging the future into the present as quickly as I can code.

            br
            |             This app allows users to take notes in a natural and intuitive way by structuring customizable cards in horizontal hierarchies.
            br
            |             Recursive algorithms highlight connected and subordinate ideas in the hierarchy, allowing users to easily prune large complicated thought processes and trace their origins.
            br
            |             The world is structured in hierarchies so a note taking app that can capture these relationships has limitless possibilities. It's great for things like ToDo lists, structuring technical papers, brainstorming, mind mapping, and a lot more!

            |             The app uses A-Frame and AngularJS for DOM manipulation to render photospheres in virtual space. The VR environments that immerses the user are equirectangular photos fetched from the Flickr API.
            br
            |             Teleporter has a unique and intuitive UI; gazing at the sphere injected into the scene opens a menu for the user to choose the theme of the photosphere they would like to be teleported to next.

            br
            br
            |             Tools like Docker are immensely useful and popular for development and deployment, however, a large problem is that they are incredibly intimidating to get started with.
            br
            |             This tutorial is a github repo designed to solve that problem and get developers from zero to using Docker as quickly as possible. Please-Contain-Yourself is a very easy-to-follow guide that provides both conceptual and practical clarity to topics such as containerization, microservices, and orchestration.
            br
            br
            |             Included in the repo are original, hands-on coding projects to exhibit both simple and advanced uses of Docker. These projects demonstrate how to use Docker in practical and useful ways such as how to containerize your development environment, deployment with Docker, coordinating multi-container applications with Docker Compose, orchestrating and scaling multi-host clusters with Docker Swarm, and more!

            |             This package provides a Promise class and some advanced helper methods all written in plain vanilla JavaScript. The module is meant to be used functionally, but Shakle is also meant to be used as an educational resource for those in the JavaScript community who want to be introduced, get better at, or need a refresher to Promises.
            br
            |             The source code is heavily commented as to provide a deep dive into not only what Promises do but also how they do it.
            br
            |             Comprehensive Mocha tests are set up for the user to easily explore the module's functionality and even extend it's functionality using Test Driven Development.

            br
            |             In Ripple, a relationship between two web services is called a concoction. A concoction follows basic cause and effect logic. Select a trigger app and event, then choose your action app and event.
            br
            br
            |             In addition to handling authentication and automatic access token renewal for over ten APIs, the app's performant backend is optimized to handle hundreds of concurrent requests and listens in the background for webhook responses from all of the user's authorized APIs. Ripple's servers dynamically and efficiently query users' concoction data to respond appropriately and accordingly.

Clicking a waypoint marker reveals photos taken at points of interest at the selected location by integrating geolocation with the Flickr API. In addition to these suggested points of interest, Wanderer also provides suggestions for places to lodge and places to eat near each waypoint, again from the integration with Google Map's API.
