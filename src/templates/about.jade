      | Hey! I'm Dylan.
      br
      | I'm an engineer at heart - I love tinkering with things, taking stuff apart, and creating problems just for the satisfaction of solving them. 
      br
      br
      |         That being said, I'm not interested in solving trivial problems like maintaining blogs.
      br
      br
      | I want to figure out how to use bleeding edge technology to solve huge, interesting, and important problems in medicine, the environment, and aerospace.
      br
      br
      |         I want to create the world that sci-fi movies painted for us. If you need me - I'll be dragging the future into the present as quickly as I can code.
