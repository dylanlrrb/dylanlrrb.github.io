Hey! thanks for checking out my web app!

To get started using it, just go to dylanlrrb.github.io 

It uses a Web Speach API that will only work in Google chrome, so if you would like to use that functionality, please use google chrome to launch this app


Once you have the web app pulled up, there are several things you can do:

Hit the record button and list some cities you would like to visit; you can also say phrases like, 'plan a trip between seattle, portland and yellowstone' or 'I want to go to paris, Prauge and greece' 

Try it out! you can name up to 8 places

You can also click to add a destination

As you add places, a route will be planned between all the locations

You can add a new destination at any time by clicking on the map or recording a new location by voice

Now click on a marker! photos from flickr are fetched that were taken around that location! pretty sweet,huh?

You can also find in the navigation overlay some links that give you the details about the trip, resturants nearby, and hotels nearby

Click on a hotel or resturant to make a reservation!

Check out all the markers on the planned route and when youre done, just click the 'start over button' to clear everything off the map and plan another adventure!

Have fun and I hope you enjoy playing with my app :]
